** Keybindings 
*** ~Cmd SPC w~ - Windows
    - ~Cmd + hjkl~ - for jumping between application windows
    - ~hjkl~ - moving windows around halves of the screen
    - ~n/p~ - moving to prev/next monitor
    - ~Alt + hjkl~ - moving in increments
    - ~Shift + hjkl~ - re-sizing active window
    - ~g~ - moving with [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.grid.html][hs.grid]]
    - ~m~ - maximize active window
    - ~u~ - undo

*** ~Cmd SPC a~ - Apps
    - ~e~ - Emacs
    - ~c~ - Chrome
    - ~t~ - Terminal
    - ~s~ - Slack
    - ~b~ - Brave

** Other features
*** Slack
     - Switching to Slack via "Apps" modal automatically opens Slack's "Jump to" dialog
     - Better way to scroll in Slack App's current thread window Ctrl-E, Ctrl-Y

** TODO: [2/9]
   - [X] Moving active window between monitors for some reason sometimes doesn't work (maybe Hammerspoon's bug?)
   - [X] Pressing ~SPC~ at any level of modal should return to the root
   - [ ] ~jk~ for exiting modals
   - [ ] I'd like to find a way to jump to Chrome window with specific profile (right now ~Ctrl-Cmd SPC a b~ will switch to Chrome, but if you have multiple profiles you have to manually find the one you need) 
   - [ ] I use Chrome Dev-tools a lot, would be nice to automate things, e.g.: Keybinding that opens devtools and creates a vertical split with main window on the left and devtools on the right
   - [ ] Being able to enter selected passwords from keychain
   - [ ] Creating splits with ease, something like in Windows 10 - it should suggest a window to place on the opposite side
   - [ ] Swapping windows in current split (left to right, up to bottom and vice-versa)
   - [ ] Better than default HUD display
