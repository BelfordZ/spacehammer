** TODO: [2/5]
   - [ ] I'd like to find a way to jump to Chrome window with specific profile (right now ~Ctrl-Cmd SPC a b~ will switch to Chrome, but if you have multiple profiles you have to manually find the one you need) 
   - [ ] I use Chrome Dev-tools a lot, would be nice to automate things, e.g.: Keybinding that opens devtools and creates a vertical split with main window on the left and devtools on the right
   - [X] Moving active window between monitors for some reason sometimes doesn't work (maybe Hammerspoon's bug?)
   - [X] Pressing ~SPC~ at any level of modal should return to the root
   - [ ] Being able to enter selected passwords from keychain
