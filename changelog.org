- Sierra compatibility
  Since Karabiner is not compatible anymore (starting with Sierra), had to find ways to get similar features
- ~keybdings~ module
- App switcher with =Cmd+j/k=
- Simple tab switcher for Chrome and iTerm2 with =Cmd+h/l=
- Simple =Vi-mode= with =Alt+j/k/l/m=
- App specific keybindings
