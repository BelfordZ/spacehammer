- Sierra compatibility
  Since Karabiner is not compatible anymore (starting with Sierra), had to find ways to get similar features
- ~keybdings~ module
- App switcher with =Cmd+j/k=
- Simple tab switcher for Chrome and iTerm2 with =Cmd+h/l=
- Simple =Vi-mode= with =Alt+j/k/l/m=
- App specific keybindings
- Changed Slack reaction key to =C-r=, so =Cmd+i= can be used to switch between current application windows
